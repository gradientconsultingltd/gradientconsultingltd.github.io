                    <p class="mb-3">Our main purpose in requesting your personal details is to provide you with a smooth and consistent experience when using our platform and when accessing the fiat-to-crypto conversion services ("Fiat Gateways") of your choice. By sharing your details with our trusted Fiat Gateway partners, you avoid the need to re-enter the same information multiple times.</p>
                    <p class="mb-3"><strong>Please note:</strong> Fiat Gateways are independently responsible for carrying out Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) checks in line with applicable laws. These processes are managed directly by the Fiat Gateways, not by GradientXchange, and we do not store or process KYC/AML data.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="h5 fw-semibold mb-2">What information we collect</h3>
